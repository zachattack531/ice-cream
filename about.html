<p>At Daryl's, we prioritize having many choices. <br>
    It's represented by our <a href="/flavors/all.html">200 flavors available</a> (not at one time).<br> 
    It's represented by our <a href="/flavors/noDairy/">dairy-free</a> and <a href="/flavors/noSugar/">no-sugar</a> options. <br>
    It's represented by our various ice-cream-adjecent choices, like <a href="/flavors/sorbet/">Sorbet</a>, or <a href="/other/piesAndBakedGoods/">Pies</a>.<br>
    And it's all driven by our customer's diversity, and our founder Eve Daryl's drive for high-quality products.</p>
